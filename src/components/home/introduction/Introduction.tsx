        'Welcome to the Healthy Cities Laboratory at HKU Department of Mechanical Engineering. Our group focuses on numerous research themes in urban area, including urban land-atmosphere interactions, urban hydro-climate, urban green infrastructure, building energy efficiency, urban fluid mechanics, and urban health. We are equipped with strong relevant research skills about model development, numerical simulation, and field experiment to investigate urban heat and moisture transport processes, city ventilation mechanisms, indoor-outdoor exchanges, human thermoregulation, climate change adaptation, etc.',

        'Rapid urbanisation and the associated landscape modification have led to numerous environmental challenges, such as urban heat stress, air pollution, limited green space, excessive energy consumption, high possibility of airborne disease transmission, etc. To tackle these challenges, we have been working on developing and evaluating smart adaptation strategies, such as city landscape reform, urban green infrastructure implementation, climate-resilient urban planning, and energy-efficient building design.',
