      "introduction": [
        "As an aspiring mechanical engineer, Sean loves learning new knowledge and skills from people who are really passionate about science and technology. The way he achieves this is by participating in numerous projects that each have a small and focused team. He genuinely believes that this is the best way to share what each person knows through active collaboration, without the need for pen and paper, but with meaningful discussions and common purposes. Some of the teams that he joined worked on various fields of engineering, such as robotics, and web technologies; all of which he has fortunately met people who taught and gave him valuable insights. These are also the people who motivate him to be better everyday than the day before.",
        "At the Healthy Cities laboratory, Sean assists its members to the best extent of his capability, which includes building a website to better promote what the lab does, as well as helping conduct experiments to understand how a personâ€™s thermal and respiratory comfort is affected by wearing a mask. Despite the short duration that he would be here, he hopes to make a positive contribution to the lab; through this work, he wishes to inspire his peers to take action, and try something different from any school curriculum."

      "introduction": [
        "Xinjie joined Healthy Cities Lab as an MPhil student at HKU in Fall 2020. Before joining HKU, he obtained his B.Eng. degree in Building Environment and Energy Engineering at Southeast University in China. His research interests focus on understanding heat and moisture transport in the complex urban environment with an emphasis on their thermal comfort impacts. Specially, his research works at our lab include developing urban canopy models with a building emission module, a street tree module, and a human thermal comfort model to better capture urban moisture dynamics and street-level thermal stress. Know more about Xinjie's works at his personal webpage (https://xinjiematthuang.github.io/)!"
