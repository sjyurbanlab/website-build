      "introduction": [
        "Xinjie joined Healthy Cities Lab at HKU as an MPhil student in Fall 2020. He obtained his B.Eng. degree in Building Environment and Energy Engineering at Southeast University in China. He is interested in microclimate, air quality, ventilation, and thermal comfort on both indoor and urban scales. Before he joined Healthy Cities Lab, he has performed several research projects on air quality, especially on indoor-outdoor air exchanges. He has also won the national first prize as team leader in the National University Student Competition on Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction. His research will focus on mechanisms and applications of vegetation-air interactions in the built environment. Apart from academic interests, Xinjie is also keen on Cantonese music and feels passionate to work in Hong Kong, which is such a metropolitan city and a unique field laboratory to study urban climate and air quality."
